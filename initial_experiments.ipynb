    "Through these experiments, we want to show two issues in studying interaction between drugs and domains.\n",
    "1. **First problem:** That when a drug interacts with a single-domain protein (with domain X), even if we correctly conclude that it interacts with domain X, It may not interact with another single domain protein that has domain X. This is easy to check using Data. For this, we need some negative interaction data and for that, we can go to affinity data.  \n",
    "2. **Second Problem:** is about multi-domain proteins and that is when a drug is interacting with a multi-domain protein (with domains X and Y), we canâ€™t confidently say if this drug interacts with X or Y or both or either or neither meaning several cases are possible:  \n",
    "    - The drug interacts with protein because it interacts directly with X\n",
    "    - The drug interacts with protein because it interacts directly with Y\n",
    "    - The drug interacts with protein because X and Y are both present\n",
    "    - The drug interacts with protein because either of X or Y are present\n",
    "    - The drug interacts because X and Y are present and they are in certain configuration with respect to each other or other extrinsic properties of the protein besides existence of X and Y.\n",
    "    - The drug interacts for a completely irrelevant reason to existence of X or Y. \n",
    "    \n",
    "There might be some overlap between the problem-1 and problem-2. But conceptually, we can say that first problem arises when trying to go from a drug-domain interaction to drug-protein interaction and the second problem arises when we go in the reverse direction. We want to see if we can quantitatively assess how prevalent these problems are or at least illuminate them as much as possible."

    "# from positive interactions to negative\n",
    "This means we infer drug-domain interactions from drug interactions of single domain proteins, and then find examples where the same domain occurs in other proteins but doesn't interact with same drugs (we have a negative interaction for it in our dataset). for this, the negative interactions are very important. common drug-target interaction databases only have positive interactions and they assume lack of a pair in the dataset to mean lack of interaction, which is obviously not correct. However there are some researches that also collect negative interaction data like [Coelho2016](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005219) where they have used affinity data to extract some negative interactions"
